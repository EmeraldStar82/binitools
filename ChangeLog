	* parse.y: yyerror() now describes the current filename when
	reporting errors

	* scan.l: moved comment priority down in the scanner

	* NEWS, ChangeLog, BUGS, AUTHORS, COPYING, COPYRIGHT: I
	initilalized all of these files.

	* README, HACKING: I wrote up all of the documentation into these
	two files.
