<h1>Freelancer BINI Tools</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Freelancer BINI tools are for unpacking and packing the Freelancer
BINI files so that you may freely modify the game.
</p>
<p>
These tools work reliably with all of the BINI files that come with
Freelancer. Each release is tested against every Freelancer BINI file
to be sure that there is no data loss or damage during conversion. The
text version of the BINI files are also 100% as expressive as the
original BINI files, with a one-to-one mapping between any possible
BINI file and its text version. These are the only known tools capable
of going back and forth between the binary and text versions.
</p>
<p>
These tools also come with extra options for analyzing BINI files and
debugging potential problems.
</p>
<p>
Note: do not mix the use of these tools with any other BINI tools when
dealing with text. The text version of these BINI files is a special
format that other tools are not designed to handle. This is what
allows these tools to properly handle all possible BINI files. If you
need to read the text versions with other tools, use the -w switch on
the unbini tool (more info below).
</p>
<p>
For example, don't unpack a BINI file with another program and then
attempt to repack them with these tools. You will have problems.
</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
These tools are available as free software under the GNU GPL. All
files are hosted <a href="files/">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>1.0.2 Release (5-30-07)</h3>
<p>
This release adds a -w switch to the unbini tool. The output when
using this switch is compatible with other BINI tools that need to
look at text versions of these files. However, when using the -w
switch, the bini tool will not be able to read the file. This release
also contains a few bug fixes.

<h3>Old Releases</h3>
<h4>1.0.1 Release (5-19-07)</h4>
<p>
Release 1.0.1 is mostly changes to the code base and the build system
(the GNU build system). The only change for users is the addition of
stdin and stdout options to both tools. See README for details.

</ul>
<h3>Subversion Repository</h3>
<p>
You can also download the latest bleeding edge version of the tools
right from the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
repository with this command:
</p>
<pre>
svn co https://opensvn.csie.org/bini/trunk binitools
</pre>
<p>
Once you have the sources from the repository, you can set up the
build environment with autoreconf (with the -i install flag):
</p>
<pre>
autoreconf -i
</pre>
<p>
The file <code>HACKING</code> describes what tools you will need to
build the sources. To build the sources on Windows, you will need <a
href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
These are the <code>bini</code> compressor options:
</p>
<pre>
Usage: bini [options] FILES

Options:

        -o file      Set output file
        -s           Summarize file details
        -t           Print string table
        -n           Do not output a file
        -v           Verbose mode
        -c           Concatenate input files
        -q           Don't print message at startup
        -h           Print this usage text
</pre>
<p>
These are the <code>unbini</code> uncompressor options:
</p>
<pre>
Usage: unbini [options] FILES

Options:

        -o file      Set output file
        -t           Print string table
        -s           Summarize file details
        -n           Do not output a file
        -v           Verbose mode
        -w           Standard INI output (no string quotes)
        -c           Concatenate input files (requires -o option)
        -q           Don't print message at startup
        -h           Print this usage text
</pre>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
There are three reasons that these tools were written:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The existing text BINI tools were poor quality.</strong> - All
of the other known BINI text tools are unable to reliably handle all
BINI files.
</li>
<li>
<strong>There were no free (as in speech) tools.</strong> All of the
other tools were not available under free licenses, nor was source
code available. These tools below are free software.
</li>
<li>
<strong>This is an interesting problem to solve.</strong> These tools
are enjoyable to write. Plus I always wanted to use <code>yacc</code>
on a real project.
</li>
</ul>
