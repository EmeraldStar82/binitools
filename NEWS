Freelancer BINI tools

1.0.1 (5-19-07)

	* There have been stdin and stdout options added to both
	tools. By using a "-" as the filename, bini and unbini will
	use stdin and stdout as necessary. See README for details.

	* Another change is the loss of mmap(). All mmap() code has
	been removed. This should simplify the unbini.c source code.

1.0 (5-15-07)

	* Now that I am satisfied with the tools and also that they
	pass all tests, I am releasing my BINI tools to the
	world. Enjoy!
