Freelancer BINI tools

1.0.1 (5-19-07)

	* There have been stdin and stdout options added to both
	tools. By using a "-" as the filename, bini and unbini will
	use stdin and stdout as necessary. See README for details.

	* The build system has been switched from a simple Makefile to
        the GNU biuld system using autoconf, automake, etc. This is
        cleaned up the code base and allowed for more reliable tests
        to make sure all releases are solid.

	* Another change is the loss of mmap(). All mmap() code has
	been removed. This should simplify the unbini.c source code.

1.0 (5-15-07)

	* Now that I am satisfied with the tools and also that they
	pass all tests, I am releasing my BINI tools to the
	world. Enjoy!
